      <description>As we close the year, it&amp;rsquo;s a good time for some housekeeping! On this occasion, I found some installation notes that could be worth transforming into proper blog posts or documentation. I went through my notes on installing Microcks on Minikube and decided to refresh them. It also needed to be completed with detailed information that we usually take for granted and forget to mention - such as network and Ingress configuration.</description>

      <title>GraphQL features in Microcks: what to expect?</title>
      <link>https://microcks.io/blog/graphql-features-what-to-expect/</link>

      <guid>https://microcks.io/blog/graphql-features-what-to-expect/</guid>
      <description>In various 2021 reports, GraphQL has been spotted as one of the most exciting technologies to consider for APIs. It is a query language and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.</description>

      <guid>https://microcks.io/blog/async-features-with-docker-compose/</guid>
      <description>For some weeks now, many users from the Microcks community were asking for playing with AsyncAPI related features without having to setup a Minikube or a full Kubernetes instance. And Docker-Compose is the perfect match for that! We were at first reluctant as it is an additional configuration to support&amp;hellip; but developers experience FTW! üí™
This blog post is a detailed walkthrough on how to use Asynchronous related features with Docker-Compose using the new set of compose files shipped in Microcks master branch.</description>

      <guid>https://microcks.io/blog/simulating-cloudevents-with-asyncapi/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: CloudEvents and AsyncAPI are complementary specifications that help define your Event Driven Architecture. Microcks allows simulation of CloudEvent to speed-up and ensure autonomy of development teams.
  The rise of Event Driven Architecture¬†(EDA) is a necessary evolution step towards cloud-native applications. Events are the ultimate weapon to decouple your¬†microservices within your architecture. They are bringing great benefits like space and time decoupling, better resiliency and elasticity.</description>

      <description>While Docker is still the #1 option for software packaging and installation on the developer laptop, Podman is gaining traction. Podman advertises itself as a drop-in replacement for Docker. Just put alias podman=docker and you would be good to go, they said üòâ
Whilst the reality is a bit more nuanced, we made the necessary adjustment to make it as simple. Today it is a pleasure to contribute back this adaptation to the Microcks community!</description>

      <description>The purpose of this post is to explain the advanced dispatching and constraint features available when mocking a REST API using Microcks. As I recently went again through the documentation answering questions on our Zulip chat, I realized that all the pieces were present but we did not have any overall example showing how to use them!
So I setup this new example based on a real life use-case our community users have submitted.</description>

      <guid>https://microcks.io/blog/continuous-testing-all-your-apis/</guid>
      <description>We talk a lot about asynchronous API lately at Microcks! We added many new innovative features taking advantage of the AsyncAPI specification. These are nice additions but we do not want them to hide the foundational essence of Microcks: offering you a consistent approach whatever the type of API. See our Why Microcks ? post for a refresher.
With this post we want to demonstrate how traditional REST API and event-based API can be used together and how Microcks can leverage your OpenAPI and AsyncAPI assets to ease the testing of scenarios involving both of them.</description>

      <description>Microcks is an amazing tool that helps developers mock their APIs seamlessly using OpenAPI specs. This makes it easy for distributed teams to develop complex micro-services without having to wait for full development cycles to complete, thus maximising team efficiencies.
Apicurio Studio is another great tool to start creating your API documentations via a fully integrated OpenAPI spec editor and adds features like ability to view your documentation live as teams collaborate and edit specs on the editor in real-time.</description>

      <guid>https://microcks.io/blog/apache-kafka-mocking-testing/</guid>
      <description>We see Apache Kafka being more and more commonly used as an event backbone in new organizations everyday. This is irrefutable. And while there are challenges adopting new frameworks and paradigms for the apps using Kafka, there is also a critical need to govern events and speed-up delivery. To improve time-to-market, organizations need to be able to develop without waiting for the whole system to be up and running ; and they will need to validate that the components talking with Kafka will send or receive correct messages.</description>

      <description>We are very thrilled to announce today Microcks 1.1.0 release ‚Äî the Open source Kubernetes-native tool for API Mocking and Testing. What a ride it has been over the last months since 1.0.0 release and our announcement of AsyncAPI support !
We received a huge amount of positive feedback from our community including many newcomers. So we took the time to come back and explain where we are coming from and what is our project purpose: see the &amp;ldquo;Why Microcks ?</description>

      <description>Microcks recently reached a key milestone as we officially announced on Aug 11th 2020 the release of Microcks 1.0.0, being our first General Availability (GA) version. With it we deliver the promise of providing an enterprise-grade solution to speed up, secure and scale your API strategy for the digital era ‚Äî whatever the type of services or API.
As we have received massive supportive feedback since August, we consider it a great opportunity to take some time to come back to the reasons why we started Microcks, especially for the newcomers.</description>

      <description>Today is a very special day as we launch Microcks 1.0.0 and as it materializes a vision we had 18 months ago when starting investing more time on what was just a fun side-project at that time. That vision was about building one simple, scalable and consolidating tool for all the Enterprise services mocking and testing needs ‚Äî whatever the type of services or API: green-field or legacy. Today, Microcks is the only Open source Kubernetes native tool for API Mocking and Testing supporting REST APIs, SOAP WebServices and now asynchronous / event-driven APIs!</description>

      <description>Whilst we recommend installing Microcks on Kubernetes for easy management and enhanced capabilities, it can also be deployed onto a regular Virtual Machine. This post details how you can setup Microcks onto an AWS EC2 instance if you‚Äôre familiar with this environment and want a quick test drive. It takes something like 6‚Äì7 minutes to complete from end-to-end. It‚Äôs an illustration of official setup documentation.
This will give you a Microcks installation on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu 18.</description>

      <description>I am delighted to announce Microcks release 0.9.0 ‚Äî the Open source Kubernetes native tool for API Mocking and Testing. This new version introduces a tremendous amount of enhancements and new features.
Big thanks to our growing community for all the work done, the raised issues and the collected feedback during the last 5 months to make it possible.
