          We are thrilled to start this New Year with a brand new Microcks release! Say hi to the 1.8.1 release of Microcks, the Open-source cloud-native tool for API Mocking and Testing 👏
This release embeds 54 resolved issues as we release an intermediary 1.8.1-M1 version to avoid some users waiting too much time. Here are the highlights of this release:
 OpenAPI complex structures support was asked to handle edge cases or organizations having a great maturity on OpenAPI, Uber/All-in-one architecture simplification was required to allow further enhancements in our Shift-Left strategy and Testcontainers support, Kubernetes deployments are now better managed with Helm enhancements, enabling greater customization for an enhanced GitOps approach!

          I&rsquo;m still on housekeeping duty! I went through my notes on installing Microcks on Kind and decided to refresh them. Network and Ingress configuration here is actually easier than in the Minikube setup.
This installation notes were ran on my Apple Mac book M2 but those steps would sensibly be the same on any Linux machine. Let&rsquo;s go 🚀
Preparation As a Mac user, I used brew to install kind. However, it is also available from several different package managers out there.

It also needed to be completed with detailed information that we usually take for granted and forget to mention - such as network and Ingress configuration.

          We are delighted to announce the 1.5.2 release of Microcks - the Open source Kubernetes-native tool for API Mocking and Testing. This is mainly an “Enhancement release” pushing further the Microcks’ Hub and Marketplace we introduced a few weeks ago.
In our vision, the Hub will hold a central place that will allow Microcks users to easily reuse curated API Mocks &amp; Test suites in a single click - but also to share and publish their own.

The goal of this new community website is to collect, curate and share API Mocks &amp; Test suites for being installed and used within any Microcks instance in a single click.
 If like us you like craft beers, let’s do the analogy between this announcement 👉 freely sharing API Mocks and Test suites and a brew bar!

Once again this release is an illustration of how community-driven the roadmap is: AMQP and Swagger v2 support as well as more enhancements came directly from user requests. So thanks a lot to those who helped push up a new release with significant features once again.

          In various 2021 reports, GraphQL has been spotted as one of the most exciting technologies to consider for APIs. It is a query language and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

This blog post is a detailed walkthrough on how to use Asynchronous related features with Docker-Compose using the new set of compose files shipped in Microcks master branch.

          TL;DR: CloudEvents and AsyncAPI are complementary specifications that help define your Event Driven Architecture. Microcks allows simulation of CloudEvent to speed-up and ensure autonomy of development teams.
  The rise of Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is a necessary evolution step towards cloud-native applications. Events are the ultimate weapon to decouple your microservices within your architecture. They are bringing great benefits like space and time decoupling, better resiliency and elasticity.

Whilst the reality is a bit more nuanced, we made the necessary adjustment to make it as simple. Today it is a pleasure to contribute back this adaptation to the Microcks community!

These are nice additions but we do not want them to hide the foundational essence of Microcks: offering you a consistent approach whatever the type of API. See our Why Microcks ? post for a refresher.
With this post we want to demonstrate how traditional REST API and event-based API can be used together and how Microcks can leverage your OpenAPI and AsyncAPI assets to ease the testing of scenarios involving both of them.

          Microcks is an amazing tool that helps developers mock their APIs seamlessly using OpenAPI specs. This makes it easy for distributed teams to develop complex micro-services without having to wait for full development cycles to complete, thus maximising team efficiencies.
Apicurio Studio is another great tool to start creating your API documentations via a fully integrated OpenAPI spec editor and adds features like ability to view your documentation live as teams collaborate and edit specs on the editor in real-time.

          We see Apache Kafka being more and more commonly used as an event backbone in new organizations everyday. This is irrefutable. And while there are challenges adopting new frameworks and paradigms for the apps using Kafka, there is also a critical need to govern events and speed-up delivery. To improve time-to-market, organizations need to be able to develop without waiting for the whole system to be up and running ; and they will need to validate that the components talking with Kafka will send or receive correct messages.

That vision was about building one simple, scalable and consolidating tool for all the Enterprise services mocking and testing needs — whatever the type of services or API: green-field or legacy. Today, Microcks is the only Open source Kubernetes native tool for API Mocking and Testing supporting REST APIs, SOAP WebServices and now asynchronous / event-driven APIs!
